I collected the dataset from Kaggle's site which was a CSV file. I had to convert it into excel. The converted excel is uploaded as IPL.xlsx.
The data had to be cleaned since there were quite a few unwanted features. The implementation of this is present in Data_Cleaning.ipynb file and the cleaned data is saved as cleanIPL.xlsx.
For building the model I had considered 5 algorithms, among them Linear Regression was giving the best prediction. The model building process is in Model_Building file. Later the model is picked and it is used in HTML file to predict the score.
